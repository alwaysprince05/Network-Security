# Network Security – Intrusion Detection ML System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Network Security Intrusion Detection ML System** is a Machine Learning-based application designed to detect malicious network activity and classify traffic as either normal or attack.

This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and documentation of a scalable intrusion detection system using modern development and ML practices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect malicious network traffic using ML models
- Reduce false positives
- Provide real-time classification
- Visualize attack insights
- Maintain scalable and modular architecture

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional security systems struggle to detect evolving cyber threats and zero-day attacks effectively. This project aims to build an intelligent detection system that can analyze network traffic data and identify anomalies using Machine Learning techniques.
